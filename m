The NFSv2/v3 umount rpc call will be sent by the 'umount' program from
userspace, not the kernel. The problem here is that because lazy mounts
exist, the lifetime of the RPC client may be longer than that of the
container. In addition, it may be shared among more than 1 container,
because superblocks can be shared.

One thing you need to be aware of here is that inode dirty data
writebacks may be initiated by completely different processes than the
one that dirtied the inode.
IOW: Aside from being extremely ugly, approaches like [PATCH 4/4] which
rely on being able to determine the container-specific node name at RPC
generation time are therefore going to return incorrect values.
