Right. I think the opportunity for problems should be pretty small.

And it's not like the pty itself wouldn't continue to work - it's just
that programs like /usr/bin/tty wouldn't be able to *find* it.

Although who knows - maybe there is some other subtle interaction.

I think the only way is to try it out.

If you can test a few distros and at least validate that the approach
isn't *totally* broken, I'll apply it. It's early days in the -rc
series yet, and this does seem to be one of those things that we'd be
better off trying to do early rather than delay.

If it causes problems, we will have to revert it and look for
alternate approaches, but if it just works it would seem to be the
right thing to do.
