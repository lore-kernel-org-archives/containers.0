If we're worried about that, one way we could address it is to tag a
pid_ns with the userid of whoever created it, and enforce that you
can only specify a pid in a pid_ns which you own.

What openvz does is have sys_restart create the whole process tree,
including custom pids (only in the new private namespaces), from inside
the kernel.  That has the same effect of only allowing specification of
pids in your own private pid namespaces.

I'm pretty sure that each of Openvz, Metacluster, and Zap are able to
checkpoint, restart, and migrate tasks which are actively using TCP.
Of course doing rollback of one endpoint of an ongoing communication
would be silly, but migration is possible.

Yes, that is why we're keeping from requiring privilege so far - to make
sure that at each step we have to consider security requirements.

The first set of patches from Oren is intended to do just that.  It
certainly did not have any sort of clone_with_pid() equivalent.
